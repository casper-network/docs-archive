"Once a bid is placed, it will remain in the state of the auction "
"contract. Even if the bid does not win a slot right away. The reason for "
"this is that new slots may become available if bonded validators leave "
"the network, or reduce their bond amounts. Therefore, a bid must be "
"explicitly withdrawn in order to remove the bid from the auction. Bonded "
"validators also have a bid in the auction, to unbond stake, this bid must"
" be reduced. Since tokens will be transferred out of the bid purse, it's "
"important to compile the contract to withdraw the bid yourself, so there "
"is confidence in the correctness of the contract.  The process is "
"essentially the same as bonding, but uses a different contract, "
"``withdraw_bid.wasm``."
