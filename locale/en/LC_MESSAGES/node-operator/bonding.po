"It is recommended that a bonding request be sent once the node has "
"completed the synchronization process. Bonding in Casper takes place "
"through the auction contract via the ``add_bid.wasm`` contract. The "
"auction runs for a future era, every era. The Chainspec specifies the "
"number of slots available, and the auction will take the top N slots and "
"create the validator set for the future era. In the testnet, era "
"durations are approx. 30 minutes. The entire process takes approximately "
"3 eras. Therefore, the time for bid submission to inclusion in the "
"validator set is a minimum of 90 minutes.\\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>` Bonding "
"requests (bids) are transactions like any other. Because they are generic"
" transactions, they are more resistant to censorship."

"The most secure way to send a bonding transaction is to compile the "
"contract and send the request to the network. Because the transaction "
"authorizes the token to be locked into the auction contract, it's really "
"important to compile the contract yourself. Here are the steps to do "
"this:"
