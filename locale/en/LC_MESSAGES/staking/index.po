"A feature of Proof-of-Stake protocols is that token holders can actively "
"participate in the protocol through a mechanism known as **staking**."

"Persons that hold their private keys can choose to stake their tokens "
"with any validator in the Casper network. Alternatively, it is possible "
"to stake tokens via an exchange or custody provider as well."

#: ../../staking/index.rst:25
msgid ""
"Presently Casper does not slash for equivocations.  If a node "
"equivocates, its' messages are ignored by the rest of the validators for "
"the balance of the era and made inactive. A node running the software "
"provided by the Casper Association will terminate once it detects that it"
" has equivocated. Future work includes locking an equivocating "
"validator's stake for an extended duration of time, effectively "
"penalizing the validator."

"Casper does not treat validator stake differently than delegator stake "

"Node operators (Validators) define a commission that they take in "
"exchange for providing staking services.  This commission is represented "
"as a percentage of the rewards that the node operator retains for their "
"services."

#: ../../staking/index.rst:38
msgid ""
"Validators receive rewards for participating in consensus by voting on "
"blocks sending finality signatures (finalizing blocks). There is no "
"precise *per-block* reward. Rewards are split proportionally among stakes"
" within an era. If a validator is offline or cannot vote on many blocks, "
"the rewards earned are also reduced. Delegators can only receive a "
"proportional amount of the validator's rewards minus the validator’s "
"commission (Delegation Rate)."

"It’s recommended that you check in on how your stake is performing from "

"selected is performing as per your expectations."

"Validators have to win a staking auction by competing with prospective "
