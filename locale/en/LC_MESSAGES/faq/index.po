"Casper is an open-source Proof-of-Stake blockchain network built off the "
"CBC (`Correct-by-Construction <https://github.com/cbc-casper/cbc-casper-"
"paper>`_) Casper specification originally established by early Ethereum "
"developers. The Casper network is optimized for enterprise and developer "
"adoption by focusing on unique features like upgradeable contracts, "
"predictable network fees, privacy flexibility, on-chain governance, and "
"developer-friendly languages. Casper solves the scalability trilemma by "
"allowing development teams to build with confidence that the network will"
" optimize for security, decentralization, and high throughput."

"As a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network, Casper relies on a set of validators "
"to uphold the network. PoS validators do not require the same hardware "
"setup as Proof-of-Work networks, allowing validators to be more "
"geographically decentralized and eliminating the centralizing pressures "
"of economies of scale. PoS also enables scalability mechanisms like "
"sharding, a forthcoming feature to allow the network to process multiple "
"transactions simultaneously, improving overall throughput."

"The Highway Protocol is the specific implementation of PoS that supports "
"the Casper network. Highway has two primary benefits over classic "
"Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanisms. First, Highway enables the"
" network to reach higher thresholds of finality. Second, it achieves "
"flexibility in a way not possible in typical BFT models. `Learn more "
"about Highway <https://blog.casperlabs.io/the-casper-network-highway-"

"Casper is optimized for enterprise and developers through three main "
"features: upgradeable contracts, developer-friendly languages, and "
"forthcoming predictable network fees."

#: ../../faq/index.rst:31
msgid ""
"**Upgradeable Contracts**. Casper enables on-chain smart contracts to be "
"directly upgraded, removing the need for complex and migration processes "
"and making it easier to patch smart contract vulnerabilities."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/index.rst:33
msgid ""
"**Developer-Friendly Languages**. Casper supports developers building "
"with WebAssembly. The network’s development ecosystem is designed to be "
"familiar to existing Web2 developers instead of being written in a "
"proprietary language like Solidity. This provides an easier path for "
"developers and businesses to start building with Casper immediately."

#: ../../faq/index.rst:35
msgid ""
"**Predictable Network Fees (In Development)**. Casper intends to "
"incentivize active and diverse network behavior by establishing "
"consistent, predictable, and transparent gas costs - eliminating "
"volatility and improving both developer and user experience."

"blockchain, enterprise technology, and financial services. Among others, "
"CasperLabs has established relationships with BitGo, Huobi, Ledger Leap, "
"Chainlink, Metis, and Cardinal Cryptography. Companies including IPwe and"
" Broadleaf are already using the Casper Network to unlock new value by "
"tokenizing existing assets."

"CSPR is the native token to the Casper network. As a Proof-of-Stake "
"blockchain, Casper relies on CSPR to reward the validators that "
"participate in the PoS consensus mechanism to secure and uphold the "
"network. Casper users also rely on CSPR to pay network fees for on-chain "
"actions. For example, each token transfer costs 0.0001 CSPR (10000 motes)"
" and the amount transferred needs to be 2.5 CSPR or more."
