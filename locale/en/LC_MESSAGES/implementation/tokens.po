"The Casper Network is a decentralized blockchain platform based on a "

"A blockchain system generally needs to have a supply of tokens available "
"to pay for computation and reward validators for processing transactions "
"on the network. The initial supply at the launch of Mainnet was 10 "
"billion CSPR. The current supply is available `here "
"<https://api.cspr.live/supply>`_. In addition to the initial supply, the "
"system will have a low rate of inflation, the results of which will be "
"paid out to validators in the form of seigniorage."

"Typically, a *token* is divisible into some number of parts. We call the "
"indivisible units which make up the CSPR token *motes*. Each CSPR is "
"divisible into :math:`10^{9}` motes. To avoid rounding errors, it is "
"essential to always represent token balances in motes.  In comparison, "
"Ether is divisible into :math:`10^{18}` parts called Wei."

msgid ""
"A *mint* is a contract that can produce new motes of a particular type. "
"We allow for multiple mote types (each of which would have its mint "
"contract) because we anticipate the existence of a large ecosystem of "
"different tokens, similar to the way Etherum works with ERC20 tokens. "
"Casper will deploy a specific mint contract, and it will manage the CSPR "
"utility token (used for paying for computation and bonding onto the "
"network). The mint also maintains all the balances for its type of mote. "
"Each balance is associated with a ``URef``, which acts as a key to "
"instruct the mint to perform actions on that balance (e.g., transfer "
"motes). Informally, we will refer to these balances as *purses* and "
"conceptually represent a container for motes. The ``URef`` is how a purse"
" is referenced externally, outside the mint."

"As all ``URef``\\ s are unforgeable, so the only way to interact with a "

msgstr ""

#: ../../implementation/tokens.rst:92
msgid ""
"It is dangerous to pass a purse's ``URef`` with ``Write`` permissions to "
"a contract. A malicious contract may use that access to take more tokens "
"than were intended or share that ``URef`` with another contract that was "
"not meant to have that access. Therefore, if a contract requires a purse "
"with ``Write`` permissions, it is always recommended to use a “payment "
"purse” -- a purse used for that single transaction and nothing else. This"
" ensures that even if the ``URef`` becomes compromised, it does not "
"contain any more funds than the user intended on giving."
msgstr ""

#: ../../implementation/tokens.rst:104

"To avoid this inconvenience, it is a better practice for application "
"developers intending to accept payment on-chain to make a version of "
"their own purse ``URef`` with ``Read`` and ``Add``  access rights "
"publicly available. This allows clients to pay via a transfer using their"

#: ../../implementation/tokens.rst:112
msgid ""
"All :ref:`accounts-head` on the Casper system have a purse associated "
"with the Casper system mint, which we call the *main purse*. However, for"
" security reasons, the ``URef`` of the main purse is only available to "
"code running in the context of that account (i.e. only in payment or "
"session code). Therefore, the mint’s ``transfer`` method which accepts "
"``URef``\\ s is not the most convenient to use when transferring between "
"account main purses. For this reason, Casper supplies a "
"`transfer_to_account <https://docs.rs/casper-"
"contract/latest/casper_contract/contract_api/system/fn.transfer_to_account.html>`_"
" function which takes the public key used to derive the :ref:`identity "
"key <global-state-account-key>` of the account. This function uses the "
"mint transfer function with the current account’s main purse as the "
"``source`` and the main purse of the account at the provided key as the "
"``target``."
