msgid ""
"**Answer**: If a deploy was executed, then it has been finalized. If the "
"deploy status comes back as null, that means the deploy has not been "
"executed yet. Once the deploy executes, it is finalized, and no other "
"confirmation is needed. Exchanges that are not running a read-only node "
"must also keep track of `finality signatures <#finality-signatures>`_ to "
"prevent any attacks from high-risk nodes."

msgid "**Question**: When are finality signatures needed?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../dapp-dev-guide/getting-help.rst:19
msgid ""
"**Answer**: Finality signatures are confirmations from validators that "
"they have executed the transaction. Exchanges should be asserting "
"finality by collecting the weight of two-thirds of transaction "
"signatures. If an exchange runs a read-only node, it can collect these "
"finality signatures from its node. Otherwise, the exchange must assert "
"finality by collecting finality signatures and have proper monitoring "
"infrastructure to prevent a Byzantine attack."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dapp-dev-guide/getting-help.rst:21
msgid ""
"Suppose an exchange connects to someone else's node RPC to send "
"transactions to the network. In this case, the node is considered high "
"risk, and the exchange must assert finality by checking to see how many "
"validators have run the transactions in the network."

msgid "**Question**: How is a deploy_hash different than a transfer_hash?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../dapp-dev-guide/getting-help.rst:27
msgid ""
"**Answer**: Essentially, there is no difference between a `deploy_hash` "
"and a `transfer_hash` since they are both deploy transactions. However, "
"the platform is labeling the subset of deploys which are transfers, to "
"filter transfers from other types of deploys. In other words, a "
"`transfer_hash` is a native transfer, while a `deploy_hash` is another "
"kind of deploy."

msgid "**Question**: Should a customer see the account-hex or the account-hash?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../dapp-dev-guide/getting-help.rst:33
msgid ""
"**Answer**: Exchange customers or end-users only need to see the "
"`account-hex`. They do not need to know the `account_hash`. The "
"`account_hash` is needed in the backend to verify transactions. Store the"
" `account-hash` to query and monitor the account. Customers do not need "
"to know this value, so to simplify their experience, we recommend storing"
" both values and displaying only the `account-hex`."
