"As mentioned in `Writing Rust Contracts <writing-rust-contracts.html"
"#using-error-codes>`_\\ , smart contracts can exit with an error code "
"defined by an `ApiError <https://docs.rs/casper-"
"types/latest/casper_types/enum.ApiError.html>`_.  Descriptions of each "
"variant are found `here <https://docs.rs/casper-"

"An ``ApiError`` of one of these sub-types maps to an exit code with an "
"offset defined by the sub-type.  For example, an ``ApiError::User(2)`` "
"maps to an exit code of ``65538`` (i.e. ``65536 + 2``\\ ).  You can find "
"a mapping from contract exit codes to ``ApiError`` variants `here "
