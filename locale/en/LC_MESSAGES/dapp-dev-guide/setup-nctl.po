"NCTL stands for network/node control. `NCTL "
"<https://github.com/CasperLabs/casper-node/tree/master/utils/nctl>`_ is a"
" CLI application you can use to set up and control multiple local Casper "
"networks during development. Many developers wish to spin up relatively "
"small test networks to localize their testing before deploying to the "
"blockchain. Adopting a standardized approach in the community is also "
"helpful for troubleshooting and reporting issues."
