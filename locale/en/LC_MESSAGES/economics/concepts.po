"The Casper network is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain that allows validators "
"to stake the Casper native token CSPR on the network. Validators receive "
"CSPR as an incentive for continuing to maintain and secure the network. "
"CSPR rewards are distributed as blocks are validated into existence and "
"organized into eras."

"**Consensus mechanism:** Casper operates using a Proof-of-Stake consensus"
" mechanism per the `Highway Protocol "
"<https://github.com/CasperLabs/highway>`_, a specification of Correct-by-"
"Construction Casper (CBC Casper)."

"**Number of validators:** The Casper network supports up to 100 "
"validators on the network. This number is chosen to strike a balance "
"between performance and decentralization. This platform parameter can be "
"increased through upgrades as development continues and performance "
"improves. In addition, validators can stake on the Casper network through"
" a process of permission-less bonding by participating in an auction for "
"the validator slot."
msgstr ""

#: ../../economics/concepts.rst:10
msgid ""
"**Permission-less bonding:** For validators to begin staking and earning "
"rewards, they must win a staking auction by competing with current and "
"prospective validators to supply one of the forthcoming top stakes for a "
"given era. This process is permission-less, meaning validators can join "
"and leave the auction without restrictions, except for a waiting period "
"to unlock staked tokens."
msgstr ""

#: ../../economics/concepts.rst:12
msgid ""
"**Unbonding:** To detach from the Casper network, it takes seven eras for"
" both validators and delegators. Neither validators nor delegators "
"receive rewards during the seven eras required for unbonding, as they are"
" not actively contributing to the network's security during that time."

msgid ""
"**Eras and block times:** An era on Casper is roughly 2 hours long. "
"Casper's Highway protocol allows validators to propose blocks as quickly "
"as network conditions allow, subject to a platform-wide limit that may be"
" adjusted with upgrades. We anticipate block times to last between thirty"
" seconds and eight minutes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../economics/concepts.rst:16
msgid ""
"**Block rewards:** Block time is orthogonal to rewards, so there is no "
"precise reward per block. Instead, the number of rewards is split "
"proportionally among stakes and reduced for failure to participate in the"
" protocol promptly."
msgstr ""

#: ../../economics/concepts.rst:18
msgid ""
"**Reward cycle:** Rewards are distributed to validators and delegators "
"once per era."

"**Annual reward percentage:** Validators on the Casper network earn "
"between 10% and 20% of their staked CSPR in the first year of the Mainnet"
" operation, with regular participation under expected network conditions."
" The growth of individual stakes is dependent on total active stake, as "
"only a fixed number of tokens is created per era."
