"Issuance provides a base level of payments for validators, so that they "
"are compensated for their work even if there is not a lot of demand for "
"using the network. By issuing new CSPR for validators, we ensure that the"
" network is secured by sufficient stake, even without the transaction "
"fees."

"CSPR is issued at a fixed rate and distributed to validators in "
"proportion to their stake. This is analogous to block rewards in Proof of"
