"Casper's economic activity can be conceptualized as taking place on four "
"distinct layers: consensus, runtime, ecosystem, and the macroeconomy. "
"Each layer, consensus and up, provides a foundation for the activity "
"taking place on the next layer. A trust-less platform requires that "
"proper incentives be provided to participants operating each of these "
"layers to ensure that they work together to unlock the platform's value."

"The consensus layer of our platform runs on the Highway flavor of CBC-"
"Casper. The distinguishing characteristics of this protocol are its "
"safety and liveness guarantees. Specifically, under the assumptions made "
"in the `Highway protocol paper <https://github.com/casper-"
"network/highway>`_, blocks in the canonical history cannot be reverted, "
"and new blocks continue to be added to this history indefinitely. The "
"assumptions, however, require that a large portion of validators remain "
"online and honest; this assumed behavior must be incentivized for the "
"platform to remain secure and live."

"*Validators* are responsible for maintaining platform security by "
"building an ever-growing chain of finalized blocks, backing this chain's "
"security with their stakes. Their importance (often referred to as "
"\"weight\") both to protocol operation and security is, in fact, equal to"
" their stake, which includes both their own and delegated tokens."
msgstr ""

#: ../../economics/index.rst:27
msgid ""
"*Delegators* are users who participate in the platform's security by "
"delegating their tokens to validators, which adds to their weight and "
"collecting a part of the rewards proportional to their delegations, net "
"of a cut (\"delegation rate\") that is collected by the validator."

"The *auction* determines the composition of the validator set for each "
"era of the protocol. It is a \"first-price\" (winning bids become stakes)"
" auction with a fixed number of spots chosen to balance security with "
"performance (generally, the platform will run slower with more "
"validators). Because rewards are proportional to the stake, we expect "
"this competitive mechanism to provide a powerful impetus for staking as "
"many tokens as possible."
msgstr ""

#: ../../economics/index.rst:34
msgid ""
"*Rewards* (per era) are issued to validators who perform, at their "
"nominal pace, in such a way as to make timely progress on block "
"finalization. These rewards are shared with delegators proportionally to "
"their contributions, net of a cut taken by the validator."
msgstr ""

"*Evictions* deactivate validators who fail to participate in an era, "
"disabling their bid and suspending their participation until they signal "
"readiness to resume participation by invoking a particular entry point in"
" the auction contract."

"The runtime layer encompasses the deployment and execution of smart "
"contracts, session code, and other activity that performs computation on "
"the global state. This suggests potential markets for finite platform "
"resources, such as markets for computing time and storage. Such markets "
"could ensure that resources are allocated to their highest-value uses. "
"Currently, however, we limit ourselves to `metering computing time "
"<https://docs.casperlabs.io/en/latest/implementation/execution-"
"semantics.html#measuring-computational-work>`_, measured as gas. Gas can "
"be conceptualized as relative time use of different WASM operations and "
"host-side functions. Use of storage is also presently assigned a gas "
"cost. We do not currently have a pricing mechanism for metered gas, "
"although an outstanding Casper Enhancement Proposal (`CEP #22 "
"<https://github.com/casper-network/ceps/pull/22>`_) suggests the "
"implementation of a first-price gas auction similar to Ethereum's. The "
"initial Mainnet deploy selection mechanism is based on FIFO."

"*Validators* again play a vital role in this layer since protocol "
"operation includes construction and validation of new blocks, consisting "
"of deploys that change the global state, which the validators also "
"maintain."

"*Transaction fees*, or charges for gas use, ensure that the users "
"compensate validators for performing their computations. Transaction fees"
" are awarded to the block creator. Because we expect to launch with FIFO "
"ordering of deploys, it can be assumed that one unit of gas will be "
"priced at one mote until future changes to deploy orders are implemented."

"prospective dApps."

msgid "Macroeconomy"
msgstr ""

#: ../../economics/index.rst:65
msgid ""
"Casper's macroeconomics refers to the activity in the cryptocurrency "
"markets, where CSPR can be treated as one cryptoasset among many rather "
"than a computational platform. Our token economics are different from "
"those of \"digital gold\" tokens like Bitcoin, designed to be scarce. Our"
" tokens are minted from a fixed starting basis, which is accounted for by"
" tokens distributed to genesis validators, employees, community members "
"and held for future distributions. The total supply of tokens grows at a "
"fixed annual percentage rate from this basis."
msgstr ""

#: ../../economics/index.rst:67
msgid ""
"The inflationary nature of our macroeconomics has two significant "
"advantages over enforced scarcity. Inflation incentivizes token holders "
"to stake or delegate their tokens, a behavior we explicitly support with "
"our delegation feature. Additionally, because Casper is a general-purpose"
" computing platform, it is essential to supply tokens to support actual "
"economic activity on the platform and discourage hoarding tokens in "
"expectation of speculative gain."
