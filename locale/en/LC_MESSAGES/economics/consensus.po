"Highway consensus is a continuous, trust-less process where a fixed set "
"of validators engage in scheduled communication to advance the linear "
"chain of finalized blocks, representing the history of changes to the "
"global state of the blockchain. The fixed set of validators may change at"
" each era boundary. The economics of this layer revolve around validator "
"selection and incentivization of participation according to the schedule."

"After genesis, the system selects a set of validators using a stake "
"auction process. The auction takes place in the last block of an era, "
"also called a switch block. An auction contract governs the validator "
"selection process, and a *chainspec* configuration file specifies a few "
"key parameters:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../economics/consensus.rst:10
msgid ""
"The ``auction_delay`` specifies the amount of time that needs to pass "
"before the system enables a new set of validators. For example, the "
"`auction_delay` is 1 for Mainnet. Therefore, after a delay of 1 era, the "
"winning validators become the validating set for the new era."

"The ``validator_slots`` parameter specifies how many validators can win "
"an auction. The auction selects a fixed number of validators based on "
"their highest bids."

msgid "Bids"
msgstr ""

#: ../../economics/consensus.rst:17
msgid ""
"Each bid is a collection of tokens from a prospective or current "
"validator and its delegators, considered in the auction as a single "
"total. Bids and delegations can increase freely, but withdrawals are "
"subject to an unbonding period governed by the ``unbonding_delay`` "
"chainspec parameter. Tokens that are in the unbonding period are not part"
" of the sum total considered in the auction. Consequently, the exact "
"amount of the bid, which translates into protocol weight for winning "
"validators, can vary within an era. The bids are visible in the switch "
"block that determines the winners."
msgstr ""

#: ../../economics/consensus.rst:19

"Each bid contains a delegation rate and activity status. The delegation "
"rate can change at any time. Both of these properties are described "
"further in this document."

msgid "Delegation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../economics/consensus.rst:24
msgid ""
"Delegation allows third parties to participate in consensus by adding "
"weight to their preferred validators. Rewards received by validators are "
"distributed in proportion to tokens bid and delegated. The current or "
"prospective validator responsible for the bid receives a portion of the "
"delegator rewards set by the delegation rate."

"Correct operation of the Highway protocol requires the economics of the "

"The network incentivizes participation by scaling rewards for on-time "

"CSPR is issued at a fixed rate and distributed to validators (and, "
