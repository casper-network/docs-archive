"The economics of the runtime layer should incentivize efficient "
"allocation of computational resources, primarily CPU time, to users. "
"Pending state pruning implementation, disk space use is treated as CPU "
"time usage and charged, irreversibly, per byte written. Currently, gas is"
" allocated according to a first-in, first-out model for deploys, with a "
"fixed price of 1 mote (1/10^9 part of a CSPR token) per 1 unit of gas."

"Any finite resource on a publicly accessible computer network must be "

"The Highway protocol in its Mainnet implementation reaches consensus on a"
" block *before* the block is executed, introducing a subtle difference "
"from platforms like Ethereum. In addition, deploys sent to the Casper "
"network can only be selected based on claimed, rather than used, gas. "
"Consequently, to incentivize user-side optimization and prevent block "
"space exhaustion by poorly optimized deploys, the platform provides no "
"refunds for unused gas."

"Additionally, a minimal amount of CSPR must be present in the user "
"account to ensure that the payment computation is covered. The community "

"Gas cost is a measure of relative time used by different primitive "
"operations of the execution engine, which is also assumed to be additive."
" By additivity, we mean that the time to execute a program is "
"approximately proportional to the sum of gas expended by the opcodes and "
"functions called within the program. Casper assigns gas costs to "
"primitive execution engine opcodes and specific more complex *host-side* "
"functions that are callable from within the execution engine context. Gas"
" costs for opcodes and host-side functions are specified in the chainspec"
" and may vary according to arguments."

"We expect to refine the current gas cost table to reflect time use more "
"closely, with updates introduced in future upgrades. We also anticipate "
"that, with the introduction of state pruning, storage costs will be "
"calculated separately from computing time."

"The block gas limit is split into two lanes, one for native transfers and"
" one for general deploys. The number of transfers, which cost a fixed "
"amount of gas, is governed directly by the ``block_max_transfer_count`` "
"chainspec parameter, set to 2500 when Mainnet launched."
