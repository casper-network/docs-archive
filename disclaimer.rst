any affected or involved jurisdiction.

Nothing in this Whitepaper constitutes an offer to sell, or a solicitation to
purchase, the tokens native to the CasperLabs blockchain (“**CLX**”). In any
event, were this Whitepaper to be deemed to be such an offer or solicitation, no
such offer or solicitation is intended or conveyed by this Whitepaper in any
jurisdiction where it is unlawful to do so, where such an offer or solicitation
would require a license or registration, or where such an offer or solicitation
is subject to restrictions. In particular, any CLX to be issued have not been,
and, as of the date of issuance of this Whitepaper, are not intended to be,
registered under the securities or similar laws of any jurisdiction, whether or
not such jurisdiction considers the CLX to be a security or similar instrument,
and specifically, have not been, and, as of the date of issuance of this
Whitepaper are not intended to be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of
1933, as amended, or the securities laws of any state of the United States of
America or any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold in any
jurisdiction where to do so would constitute a violation of the relevant laws of
such jurisdiction.

This Whitepaper constitutes neither a prospectus according to Art. 652a of the
Swiss Code of Obligations (the "**CO**") or Art. 1156 CO nor a prospectus or
basic information sheet according to the Swiss Financial Services Act (the
"**FinSA**") nor a listing prospectus nor a simplified prospectus according to
Art. 5 of the Swiss Collective Investment Schemes Act (the "**CISA**") nor any
other prospectus according to CISA nor a prospectus under any other applicable
laws.

The CLX are not expected to be instruments in an offer and sale which are
subject to the jurisdiction or oversight of the U.S. Securities Exchange
Commission (the “**SEC**”). In any event, however, CLX have not been approved or
disapproved by, and are not expected to be approved or disapproved by, the SEC
nor by the securities regulatory authority of any state of the United States of
America or of any other jurisdiction, and neither the SEC nor any such
securities regulatory authority has passed, or is expected to pass, upon the
accuracy or adequacy of this Whitepaper.

The distribution of this Whitepaper and the purchase, holding, and/or disposal
of CLX may be restricted by law in certain jurisdictions. Persons reading this
Whitepaper should inform themselves as to (i) the possible tax
consequences, (ii) the legal and regulatory requirements, and (iii) any foreign
exchange restrictions or exchange control requirements, which they might
encounter under the laws of the countries of their citizenship, residence or
domi-cile and which might be relevant to the purchase, holding or disposal
of CLX. No action has been taken to authorise the distribution of this
Whitepaper in any jurisdiction in which such authorisation might be required.

No action has been or is intended to be taken by CasperLabs Networks AG and/or
any of its affiliates in any jurisdiction that would or is intended to, permit a
public sale or offering of any CLX, or possession or distribution of this
Whitepaper (in preliminary, proof or final form) or any other sale, offering or

**Risk Factors**

Furthermore, by accepting this Whitepaper, the recipient of hereof (the
“**Recipient**”) acknowledges and agrees that it understands the inherent risks
associated with blockchain and distributed ledger technology, tokens and
cryptocurrencies in general and the CLX in particular, including, but not
limited to, those outlined hereinafter.

- **Risks associated with CasperLabs Networks AG’s experience**: the
  Recipient is aware that CasperLabs Networks AG and its affiliates constitute a
  start-up group of companies. Inability of such companies to manage their
  affairs, including any failure to attract and retain appropriate personnel,
  could affect the completion and functionality of the CasperLabs blockchain.
- **Risks associated with CLX relative value**: the Recipient understands and
  accepts that a purchaser of CLX may experience financial losses relative to
  other assets, including fiat currency and/or any other cryptocurrency (including
  any cryptocurrency used to acquire CLX). Potential purchasers and holders of CLX
  are urged to carefully review this Whitepaper and assess and understand the risk
  factors relating to the CLX and the CasperLabs blockchain before acquiring CLX
  (when and if CLX become available).
- **Risks associated with (intellectual) property rights**: the Recipient
  understands and accepts that, due to a lack of originality of the software and
  to the immaterial character of the CLX, there may be no title of ownership in
  and to the intellectual property rights relating to CLX.
- **Risks associated with blockchain**: the Recipient understands and accepts
  that the smart contract, the underlying software application and software
  platform (i.e. the CasperLabs blockchain) is still in an early development stage
  and unproven. The Recipient understands and accepts that there is no warranty
  that the process for creating the CLX and/or the CasperLabs blockchain will be
  uninterrupted or error-free and acknowledges that there is an inherent risk that
  the software could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs causing, inter
  alia, the complete loss of CLX. The Recipient understands and accepts that,
  after launch of the CasperLabs blockchain, the smart contract and/or underlying
  protocols and/or the CasperLabs blockchain and/or any other software involved
  may either delay and/or not execute a contribution due to the overall
  contribution volume, mining attacks and/or similar events.
- **Risk of weaknesses in the field of cryptography**: the Recipient
  understands and accepts that cryptography is a technology that evolves
  relatively fast over time. At the same time, methods and tools to decrypt,
  access and/or manipulate data stored on a distributed ledger or blockchain are
  highly likely to progress in parallel and in addition, new technological
  developments such as quantum computers may pose as of now unpredictable risks to
  the CLX and the CasperLabs blockchain that could increase the risk of theft or
  loss of CLX (if and when CLX are created and/or issued).
- **Regulatory risks**: the Recipient understands and accepts that it is
  possible that certain jurisdictions will apply existing regulations on, or
  introduce new regulations addressing, distributed ledger technology and/or
  blockchain technology based applications, which may be contrary to the current
  setup of the smart contract or the CasperLabs Networks AG project and which
  may, inter alia, result in substantial modifications of the smart contract
  and/or the CasperLabs Networks AG project, including its termination and the
  loss of the CLX, if and when created and/or issued, or entitlements to receive
  CLX, for the Recipient.
- **Risks associated with abandonment / lack of success**: the Recipient
  understands and accepts that the creation of the CLX and the development of the
  CasperLabs blockchain as well as the CasperLabs Networks AG project may be
  abandoned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest from the public,
  lack of funding, lack of prospects (e.g. caused by competing projects) and
  legal, tax or regulatory considerations. The Recipient therefore understands
  that there is no assurance that, even if the CLX/CasperLabs blockchain project
  is partially or fully developed and launched, the Recipient will receive any
  benefits through the CLX held by it (if and when created and/or issued).
- **Risks associated with a loss of private key**: the Recipient understands
  and accepts that CLX, if and when created and/or issued, will only be accessed
  by using a wallet technically compatible with CLX and with a combination of the
  Recipient’s account information (address) and private key, seed or password. The
  Recipient understands and accepts that if its private key or password gets lost
  or stolen, the CLX associated with the Recipient's account (address) will be
  unrecoverable and will be permanently lost.
- **Risks associated with wallets:** the Recipient understands and accepts
  that CasperLabs Networks AG or any of its affiliates, employees, partners or
  advisors are in no way responsible for the wallet to which any CLX are
  transferred. The Recipient understands and agrees that it is solely responsible
  for the access and security of its wallet, for any security breach of its wallet
  and/or with any loss of CLX resulting from its wallet service provider,
  including any termination of the service by the wallet provider and/or
  bankruptcy of the wallet provider.
- **Risks associated with theft/hacks**: the Recipient understands and accepts
  that the smart contract, the website, the underlying software application and
  software platform (i.e. the CasperLabs blockchain), during its development and
  after its launch, may be exposed to attacks by hackers or other individuals that
  could result in an inability to launch the CasperLabs blockchain or the theft or
  loss of CLX. Any such event could also result in the loss of financial and other
  support of the CasperLabs Networks AG project impacting the ability to develop
  the CasperLabs Networks AG project and CasperLabs blockchain.
- **Risks associated with mining attacks**: the Recipient understands and
  accepts that, as with other cryptocurrencies and tokens, if and when launched,
  the CasperLabs blockchain is susceptible to attacks relating to validators. Any
  successful attack presents a risk to the smart contract, expected proper
  execution and sequencing of transactions, and expected proper execution and
  sequencing of contract computations.
- **Risks associated with a lack of consensus**: the Recipient understands and
  accepts that the network of validators will be ultimately in control of the
  genesis block and future blocks and that there is no warranty or assurance that
  the network of validators will perform their functions and reach proper
  consensus and allocate the CLX to the Recipient as proposed by any terms. The
  Recipient further understands that a majority of the validators could agree at
  any point to make changes to the software and/or smart contracts and to run the
  new version of the software and/or smart contracts. Such a scenario could lead
  to the CLX losing intrinsic value.
- **Risks associated with liquidity of CLX**: the Recipient understands and
  accepts that with regard to the CLX, if and when created and/or issued, no
  market liquidity may be guaranteed and that the value of CLX relative to other
  assets, including fiat currency and/or any other cryptocurrency (including any
  cryptocurrency used to acquire CLX) over time may experience extreme volatility
  or depreciate in full (including to zero) resulting in loss that will be borne
  exclusively by the Recipient.
- **Risks associated with forking**: the Recipient understands and accepts
  that hard and soft forks as well as similar events may, inter alia, lead to the
  creation of new or competing tokens to the CLX, adversely affect the
  functionality, convertibility or transferability or result in a full or partial
  loss of units or reduction (including reduction to zero) of value of the
  Recipient's CLX (if and when created and/or issued).
